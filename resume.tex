\section{research}

\begin{entrylist}
  \entry
	{'17-'18}
	{Resilient Mission Planning}
	{graduate research}
	{Designed an algorithm that will assign tasks to a number of deployed assets, and will unassign/reassign tasks as necessary in order to best satisify the constraints of the missions such as drone survival, intel retrieval, etc.}
  \entry
	{'16-'17}
	{Pump Profiling}
	{graduate research}
	{Developed a prediction algorithm that would use machine learning to study gas pump data, create a gas pump profile, and then predict when the gas pump was going to fail.}
  \entry
    {'16}
    {Red}
    {undergraduate research}
    {Evaluation of Red, a bioinformatics tool for detecting repeats denovo in nucleotide sequences.}
  \entry
    {'13-'14}
    {RFID Research Grant}
    {undergraduate research}
    {Developed protocols to concisely and securely store standard, adult vaccination information on 2000 bit RFID tags.}
  \entry
    {'13}
    {Tulsa Undergraduate Research Challenge}
    {undergraduate research}
